# Automatic-number-plate-recognition-system
This project involves developing a system that automatically recognizes and reads vehicle license plates from images or video streams. The system will use image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and extract license plate numbers from various environments, including different lighting and weather conditions.
